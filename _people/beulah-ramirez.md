Yasmine El Garhi will soon be assuming her dream job. The NJIT senior, who will graduate this December with a dual degree in Sociology and Business, already has landed a position as a user experience designer on the design team at IBM—“the exact role that I want,” she said.

El Garhi will be involved in design thinking at the venerable technology corporation to help solve real, complex problems and create new, more effective strategies around IBM products, always with the end user in mind. She describes the process as a continuum of research, design, testing and, as necessary, fine-tuning before developers take over to code, retest and launch products.

She began a co-op at IBM in its Poughkeepsie, N.Y., office this past summer and made such a great impression on the company, it not only extended her stay for the fall semester, but also offered her a full-time job. In addition to completing her final classes at the university, she now puts in 20 hours a week for IBM, visiting the Poughkeepsie headquarters, which takes her three hours to get there, one day every other week. Come this January, after she graduates from NJIT, she will embark on a three-month IBM design boot camp in Texas and then relocate to upstate New York.
