Joan is a PhD student in the Department of Sociology at Columbia.  Her primary research interests include interactions of law, technology, and gender.  All of her research speaks to the broader question, how do non-human apparatuses shape, maintain, and challenge inequalities.

Previously, she worked for five years as a staff attorney at [The Legal Aid Society](http://www.college.columbia.edu/) in New York City, the oldest, largest, and most influential legal services provider in the U.S., where she represented low-income New Yorkers in their civil cases in the Bronx and Brooklyn. Her former clients and colleagues at Legal Aid continue to inspire her work. In 2010, she enrolled in a PhD program at Columbia, making her academic fantasies a reality. She is thankful every day for the privilege to be able to pursue this type of work.
