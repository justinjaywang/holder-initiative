The Eric H. Holder Initiative is a new program at [Columbia University](http://www.college.columbia.edu/) which offers courses, events, and resources to students who are interested in public service and justice.

## Our Mission

The mission of the Eric H. Holder Initiative is to inspire, support, and enable students interested in public service and justice. We strive to create a nurturing community where they can flourish. We do this through by connecting and engaging with the community through campus events, offering courses related to public service and justice, and providing resources for students.

The initiative takes its name from Eric H. Holder, former attorney general under President Barack Obama, Columbia alumnus, and former Trustee. It was created in conjunction with the Ford Foundation. This is only placeholder text, so make sure to edit.

To get there, he had a long journey that began during his studies at Columbia University, which set the foundation for his interest in public service and justice. In 1969, while a freshman at Columbia, Holder was one of several dozen students who staged an occupation of the Reserve Officers' Training Corps office, renaming it as the Malcolm X student center.
